## Description

I created this project using the Builder Bot library, a library that allows you to create automated conversation flows without relying on a specific WhatsApp provider. It can be configured to provide automatic responses to frequently asked questions, automatically manage incoming and outgoing messages, and track interactions with users. It also offers the possibility to set custom triggers to expand its capabilities without restrictions.

## Quick Installation

To create a new project with BuilderBot run:

```
npm create builderbot@latest
```

To run the bot, execute:
```
npm run dev
```

## Documentation

This project uses and adapts information from the [official BuilderBot documentation](https://builderbot.vercel.app/), consult to learn how to use all the features and characteristics of the library.
